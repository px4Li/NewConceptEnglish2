## Lesson 3 Please send me a card
> Postcards always spoil my holidays. Last summer, I went to Italy. I visited museums and sat in public gardens. A friendly waiter taught me a few words of Italian. Then he lent me a book. I read a few lines, but I did not understand a word. Every day I thought about postcards. My holidays passed quickly, but I did not send cards to my friends. On the last day I made a big decision. I got up early and bought thirty-seven cards. I spent the whole day in my room, but I did not write a signle card!


### Lesson 88 Trapped in a mine

> Six men have been trapped in a mine for seventeen hours. If they are not brought to the surface soon they may lose their lives. However, rescue operations are proving difficult. If explosives are used, vibrations will cause the roof of the mine to collapse. Rescue workers are therefore drilling a hole on the north side of the mine. They intend to bring the men up in a special capsule. If there had not been a hard layer of rock beneath the soil, they would have completed the job in a few hours. As it is, they have been drilling for sixteen hours and they still have a long way to go. Meanwhile, a microphone, which was lowered into the mine two hours ago, has enabled the men to keep in touch with their closest relatives. Though they are running out of food and drink, the men are cheerful and confident that they will get out soon. They have been told that rescue operations are progressing smoothly. If they knew how difficult it was to drill throught the hard rock, they would lose heart.

### Lesson 93 A noble gift
> One of the most famous monuments in the world, the Statue of Liberty, was presented to the United States of America in the nintteenth century by the people of France. The great statue, which was designed by the sculptor *Auguste Bartholdi*, took ten years to complete. The actual figure was made of copper supported by a metal framework which had been especially constructed by Eiffel. Before it could be transported to the United States, a site had to be found for it and a pedestal had to be built. The site chosen was an island at the entrance of New York Harbour. By 1884, a statue which was 151 feet tall had been erected in Paris, The following year, it was taken to pieces and sent to America. By the end of Octorber 1886, the statue had been put together again and it was officially presented to the American people by *Bartholdi*. Ever since then, the great monument has been a symbol of liberty for the millions of people who have passed through New York Harbour to make their homes in America.

### Lesson 94 Future champions

>Experiments have proved that children can be instructed in swimming at a very early age. At a special swimming pool in Los Angeles, children become expert at holding their breath under water even before they can walk. Babies of two months old do not appear to be reluctant to enter the water. It is not long before they are so accustomed to swimming that they can pick up weights from the floor of the pool. A game that is very popular with these young swimmers is the underwater tricycle race. Tricycles are lined up on the floor of the pool seven feet under water. The children compete against each other to reach the other end of the pool. Many pedal their tricycles, but most of them prefer to push or drag them. Some children can cover the whole length of the pool without coming up for breath even once. Whether they will ever become future Olympic champions, only time will tell. Meanwhile, they should encourage those among us who cannot swim five yards before they are gasping for air.


### Lesson 95 A fantasy

> When the Ambassador of Escalopia returned home for lunch, his wife got a shock. He looked pale and his clothes were in a frightful state.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'What has happened?' She asked. 'How did your clothes get into such a mess?'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A fire extinguisher, my dear,' answered the Ambassador drily. 'University students set the Embassy on fire this morning.'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Good heavens!' exclaimed his wife. 'And where were you at the time?'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I was in my office as usual,' answered the Ambassador. 'The fire broke out in the basement. I went down immediately, of course, and that fool, *Horst*, aimed a fire extinguisher at me. He thought I was on fire. I must definitely get that fellow posted.'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ambassador's wife went on asking questions, when she suddenly noticed a big hole in her husband's hat.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And how can you explain that?' she asked.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Oh, that,' said the Ambassador. 'Someone fired a shot through my office window. Accurate, don't you think? Forunately, I wasn't wearing it at the time. If I had been, I would not have been able to get home for lunch.'

### Lesson 96 The dead return

>A Festival for the Dead is held once a year in Japan. This festival is cheerful occasion, for on this day, the dead are said to return to their homes and they are welcomed by the living. As they are expected to be hungry after their long journey, food is laid out for them. Specially-made lanterns are hung outside each house to help the dead to find their way. All night long, people dance and sing. In the early morning, the food that had been laid out for the dead is thrown into a river or into the sea as it is considered unlucky for anyone living to eat it. In towns that are near the sea, the tiny lanterns which had been hung in the streets the night before, are placed into the water when the festival is over. Thousands of lanterns slowly drift out to sea guiding the dead on their return journey to the other world. This is a moving spectacle, for crowds of people stand on the shore watching the lanterns drifting away until they can be seen no more.
