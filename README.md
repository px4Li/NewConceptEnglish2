Last week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat. The play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it. A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. I got very angry. I could not hear the actors. I turned round. I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end, I could not bear it. I turned round again. 'I can't hear a word!' I said angrily.
   'It's none of your business,' the young man said rudely.'This is a private conversation!'

It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sundays. I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime. Last Sunday I got up very late. I looked out of the window. It was dark outside. 'What a day!' I thought. 'It's raining again.' Just then, the telephone rang. It was my aunt Lucy. 'I've just arrived by train,' she said. I'm coming to see you.'
	'But I'm still having breakfast,' I said.
	'What are you doing?' she asked.
	'I'm having breakfast,' I repeated. 
	'Dear me,' she said. ' Do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock!'
